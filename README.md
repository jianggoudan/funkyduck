We have uploaded two files. one is unity project, the second is  a web game. You should put it on web service, like apache. 
The unity version is Unity 2019.3.12f1 (64-bit).
One problem here. when we open the project in unity and run the character scene, those four buttons may not work. Because
the name :"Selector_script" is different from Selector_Manager script name. I do not know why. It ofen happens.
when you play the game. first of all open the name scene in unity, input your name. Then the high score button can display your name and your score.
The play button will go to the easy level, to medium level and then to the hard level. You can also click the levels button to choose any level that you like.
The instructions button will show you how to play the game.
The Credits button can dispaly our teammates.
The Demo button will go to the easist level and let you play as long as you want without the countdown timer and lives.
Click character button, you can select different characters. But unfortunately the final character is still a fox in the main level. Despite our best efforts we were not able to finish this functions
Collect the 2 stars and the vault to go to the next level and try your best to collect bananas as the get you the high score!
Enjoy the game!
