I upload two files. one is unity project, the second is  a web game. You should put it on web service, like apache. 
The unity version is Unity 2019.3.12f1 (64-bit).
One problem here. when open the project and run the character scene, those four buttons may dose not work. Because
the name :"Selector_script" is different from Selector_Manager's script's name. I do not know why. It ofen happens.
when you play the game. first of all, input your name. Then the high score button can display your name and your score
the play button will go to the easy level to hard level. you also can click levels button, and choose any level that you like.
the instructions button will show you how to play the game.
the Credits button can dispaly our teammates.
the Demo button will go to the easist level and let you know how to pass those level.
click character button, you can select different characters. but the final character is still a rat. we have not finish this functions
collect 3 stars and try your best to collect bananas!
enjoy game!
